        <p style="color:white">The F.W. Olin Library houses a vast collection of over 240.000 texts and media that cover literature, 
            music, dance, gender, sexuality, ethnic studies, and leisure topics. The library also has an online database that you can 
            access remotely. Additional research support resources are also offered, such as the library faculty. The library also has 
            the Special Collections (Oakland) available for students, staff, and other scholars. This collection contains fine press 
            books, artists' books, early printed books, manuscripts, and archives in the library's Elinor Raas Heller Rare Book Room. 
            The library has several study rooms and workstations that students use daily. Carnegie Hall used to be the library site 
            before it was moved (the fourth time) to the F.W. Olin Library. The library will always welcome you in if you need a good 
            book or a quiet room to study in.
