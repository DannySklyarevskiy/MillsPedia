        <p style="color:white">Mills Hall initially housed the entire College with the classrooms, residence halls,
            dining hall, and library all in one building. In 2014, Mills was the first women’s
            college in the US to develop a formal transgender admissions policy. Our policy
            also included gender nonbinary students. Many women's colleges in the US had
            unofficial positions on admitting transgender students, but we were the first to
            put it in writing so students knew clearly and upfront whether they would be able
            to attend and remain enrolled at Mills.</p>

        <p style="color:white">Mills Hall, considered one of the most beautiful educational buildings in California, 
            is the oldest and most prolific building on this historic campus. The hall, named after Susan and Cyrus Mills, 
            had originally served as the entire campus where students would take classes and reside. Some of the very first 
            Mills students could take a telegraphy course utilizing a special art room within the building.  However, currently, 
            the hall houses several classes of varying subjects and administrative offices; it even serves as housing for 
            some faculty. Furthermore, if any guest arrives on campus they can opt-in to stay at the very top floor in special 
            guest bedrooms. Within Mills Hall are several special tea kettles from all over the world that a former Mills President 
            collected during their lifetime (With the rest of the collection residing in the Alumni House). In all, Mills Hall is 
            more than just a building it’s a repository of the deep history and culture permeating the campus, a story that only 
            grows richer with time.</p>
