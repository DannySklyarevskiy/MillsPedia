        <p style="color:white"> The clocktower you see across from the Oval is called El Campanil. Built in 1904,
            was one of the first reinforced concrete buildings west of the Mississippi. It was
            designed by Julia Morgan, one of America’s first female architects, renowned for
            designing California’s legendary Hearst Castle in San Simeon, Morgan also
            designed many buildings in the Bay Area, including many churches and homes in
            the area, and the YWCAs in Oakland and San Francisco’s Chinatown. It was one of
            the few structures that remained untouched and unscathed
            during both the great 1906 earthquake of San Francisco as
            well as the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. El Campanil
            is one of six buildings she designed for Mills, five of which still stand today. </p>
